- As a user, I should be able to open the recipe Iâ€™m interested in and get more expanded information (image, ingredients, nutrition facts).
- As a user, I should be able to add a new recipe.
- As a user, I should be able to edit or delete the recipe.
- As a user, I should be able to have a return button from the recipe page.
